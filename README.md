# CoolShapes-virus
This is a virus that I created and it's about screensavers.Basically once you run it the OS is very hard to use because a bunch of links is opened.


# About

The virus is written in C# and is open-source.Once you download the VS project you can do whatever you want with the code.
If you want to just open the virus without publishing it,just go to virus2\virus2\publish\Application Files\CoolShapes_1_0_0_0\CoolShapes.zip.
Before extracting,make sure you turn off your antivirus.

# Build

Go to project window,virus2 properties then go to publish and hit "Publish now".You don't need to modify something,everything is setted up.
